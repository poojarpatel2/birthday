        const textToType = ` So basically I coded you a little website.
        I know it's not all that, it was more for me 
        to geek over despite it being rather simple
        but here it is lolz. It took me a month to make not going to lie and I still 
        could not figure out the code on how to fix the pictures portion.
        Anyways, I hope you have the most amazing 21st birthday ever!! Crazy to think 
        that we've known each other since we were 16, time has flew. Okay so I'm 
        about to say some nice things ig so don't cringe at it or else I'm going to be 
        embarassed. We have been through a lot but I truly believe all of that has just
        made us stronger. There is a reason why despite everything, I am led back to you.
        You always ask me why I like you and I just say it's because you're patient but 
        something as small as that is so necessary for me. I'm not going to say you're 
        not impatient because you literally are but you are patient with me. You talk
        things out, you don't let me just shut you out and I really do appreciate that. 
        You are truly the kindest soul I know, an optimist, and believer which is so admirable.
        You care for your friends, family, and me so deeply and I just need you to know that
        is acknowledged and valued. I look forward talking to you everyday, and even with 
        the distance between us I do not feel the lack of love you withold. I look forward
        to the day that the distance is no longer there. I cherish every moment we share, 
        our laughter, our shared dreams, and even our moments of vulnerability.
        The way you try to understand me and do understand me, the way you make me feel 
        seen is something I have never experienced before. You have a way of filling
        spaces in my heart that I didn't even know were empty. With you, I feel complete.
        I truly hope you have the best birthday ever, I don't know anyone else that deserves 
        it more than you.
